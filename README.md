Correlation Library for Excel
An Excel add-in that brings together a collection of Users Defined Excel functions for estimating PVT properties of hydrocarbons commonly found in crude oil and gas/gas condensate deposits.

Originally created as an Excel 97-2003 add-in.

I hope to migrate it to newer versions of Excel and undertake a larger project in Python.
